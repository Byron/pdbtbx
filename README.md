## Description
Primarily a hobby project to work more with Rust, but with a bit of luck it could end up being useful for someone. For now (27 Dec 2020) it can parse simple (crystallographic) PDBs, edit the PDB in place, gives some handy functionality and is able to save the PDB.

## License
MIT, just use it if you can use it, if you use it for something cool I would like to hear, but no obligations!

## PDB format
PDB 3.30 as published by wwPDB in 2008 (newest at time of creation)

## Why
Just for fun, to play with fancy abstractions. But at the same time I think tht using Rust in scientific computing would be really cool and this library would be needed if I where to be doing my internship in Rust. So by creating it I hope to extend the usability of Rust a little bit more.
