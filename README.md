Primarily a hobby project to work more with Rust, but with a bit of luck it could end up being usefull for someone. For now (18 Dec 2020) it can parse simple (crystallographic) PDBs. I plan on reworking the parser to a streaming based one to get it to be faster and use way less memory, plus I plan to introduce pdb saving features and pdb editing features to make it usefull for simple PDB editing in Rust.
